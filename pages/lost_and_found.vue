        Hello! If you're reading this, it means you've found my laptop. I'm really grateful that you took
        a moment to scan the QR code.
        <h2 class="text-h5">How You Can Help</h2>
        If you could return the laptop to me, I would be incredibly thankful.

        If you feel comfortable, we can arrange for the laptop to be returned in person, or I can
        organize for it to be picked up at a location that suits you.
        <h2 class="text-h5">Thank You</h2>
        It's amazing to see that there are still people in the world who are willing to help others.
        Thank you for your time and for deciding to do the right thing.
